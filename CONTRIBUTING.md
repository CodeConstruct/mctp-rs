# Contributing to mctp-rs

If you wish to contribute, please file a pull request with the following
characteristics.

- Include a `Signed-off-by` trailer on each commit log message to indicate that
  you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). `git commit -s` makes
  adding the `Signed-off-by` tag easy.

  In short, this asserts that you have the right to contribute this change -
  either being your own work, or you are submitting it under a suitable
  license.

  The text of the DCO is available at <https://developercertificate.org/>

- Pull requests and/or commits that modify a single crate should have a title
  that begins with that crate's name. E.g. `mctp-estack: Use inbuilt MCTP
  header parser`.
